# Coding_Challenge

This application is developed using Spring Boot for the backend (API) services, H2 as in-memory database and React for the frontend user interface.

Please ensure that you have:
- Java installed for running the Spring Boot application.
- Node.js and npm should be installed for running the React application.

Please go to the "backend" directory and run the CodingChallengeApplication class to start the Spring Boot application (API services).
Then follow by navigating to the frontend directory, open a terminal and run the "npm install" command to install all the dependencies, 
then "npm run dev" to start the web server. The url will be "http://localhost:5173/". If the browser doesn't open automatically, press the letter "o"
and it should open to the right url.

The data displayed on the table can be sorted by id or country(asc.).

Thank you!
